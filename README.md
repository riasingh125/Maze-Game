# Maze-Game
The way our game is supposed to work is that when the player runs the program, 
a maze is created, with a green square representing the starting point, and a 
red square to represent the end point. Then the player can pick one of three ways to play our game.
First, the player can choose to manually play the game using the up, down, and side to side arrows
on the keyboard, allowing the player to manually move the square throught the maze, creating a path as they move.
Second, the player can press the b key for the program to perform breath first search in order to complete the maze, 
and then show the path from the end to the start after it is done. 
Thirdly, the player can press the d key for the program to perform depth first search in order to complete the maze, 
and then show the path from the end to the start after it is done. At the end of all three, 
once the game is finished and the path has been found, a scren should display a message telling the 
player that they won! After this, or during the game at any point, the player should be able to press
the r key on the keyboard in order to reset the game and start again, choosing either the same, 
or different way to search through the maze/play the game.
